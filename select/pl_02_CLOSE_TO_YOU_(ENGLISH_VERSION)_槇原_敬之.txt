Is it you,
that I see walking
down the street
I call out your name
in a desperate hope
It's you
that I need by my side
you know
my arms are open wide
I can't help the way
that I feel inside
I know that a good thing
is hard to find
So come on
and get a little
closer to love
I can't get you
out of my mind
The time has come,
for us to work it out
l've got to get
to you some how
My heart skips a beat,
when you're near to me
coz you are the one
that I adore
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
hand in hand,
just me and you
together we can set
our loving free
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
the two of us forever
loving in harmony
You know,
I can see sadness deep
in your eyes
The smile that you wear,
is just a disguise
I know true love is strong
and it will never die
absence makes the heart
stronger
When I hear
your sweet voice
on the telephone
I can't help but drown
in my memories
I'm looking at your picture
hanging on my wall
and wish you
could be here with me
My hearts in a cage
only you can set me free
without you
my whole world is blue
I won't make the same mistake
if I got the chance
to be with you
all over again
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
hand in hand,
just me and you
together we can set
our loving free
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
the two of us forever
loving in harmony
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
hand in hand,
just me and you
together we can set
our loving free
You're the only one
You're the only one
feels so good,
when I'm close to you
the two of us forever
loving in harmony
